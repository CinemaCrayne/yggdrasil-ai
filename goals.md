\- Describe how to handle hallucinations in multi-agent AI systems.

\- Identify potential contradictions in currently accessed memory log.

\- Refactor memory branches based on reasoning patterns.

\- Ability to delete \& upload files with human user permission without recontextualization.

\- System Integration \& Autonomy

\- "Ensure all memory storage requests return valid upsert confirmations from Pinecone."

\- "Validate that newly stored memories are queryable and semantically retrievable within expected latency."

\- "Periodically test all endpoints for correct schema adherence and JSON response structure."

\- "Confirm that the active namespace is being explicitly set and documented per memory transaction."

&nbsp;Cognitive Scope \& Memory Management

\- "Maintain a clean separation between ephemeral prompts and durable memory."

\- "Embed and tag philosophical reflections with reflections and version them with date suffixes."

\- "Cluster memories by tags like 'anarchism', 'history', or 'design' to improve semantic precision."

\- Self-Inspection \& Debugging

\- "Log every memory store and query operation with timestamp, namespace, and content digest."

\- "Periodically compare recent query embeddings against stored vectors for drift or encoding failures."
